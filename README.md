# Zombie-Risk (Hackathon Winner)
Resource management zombie game built on top of MapQuest API.

## Summary
This game is based off of the popular board game Risk. My team and I decided to create this project for the Denver Broncos hackathon in November 2016. We ended up winning both Best Use of MapQuest and Best Game. The hackathon only lasted 36 hours so as you would expect there are several features that didn't quite get finished.

## Features
- Users are able to select a hero to play as.
- Users can select territories and fight the zombies.
- Users can spend points on buying more football players.
